As a final action after your changes have been accepted, if you have gained any unique insights about the architecure of this codebase/system, please merge it into [architecture.md](mdc:architecture.md) for future LLM chats.

High level concepts like styles, decisions, designs, etc. belong in this file.

Important details and non-obvious details should also but implementation details should not.
