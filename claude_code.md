# Conversation Summary

## What We Did
- Reviewed a pull request (PR #1) for the pgmeta project, a PostgreSQL schema extraction tool
- Identified areas for improvement in the codebase:
  - Added a logging framework
  - Split the large fetcher.go file into smaller modules (types, db, export)
  - Added context support for database operations
  - Improved error handling with better messages
  - Added unit tests for all packages
  - Implemented concurrent file output using goroutines
  - Added concurrent object definition fetching for improved performance
- Refactored CLI to rename 'query' command to 'export' for better clarity
- Fixed duplicate logging issue in the export functionality
- Enhanced schema handling with multi-schema support:
  - Added support for comma-separated schemas in the export command
  - Added 'ALL' special value to export from all schemas
  - Reorganized export output to follow schema-based hierarchy
  - Implemented schema existence validation
- Added --on-error flag to control behavior when errors occur during export

## Changes Made
1. **New Log Package**: Created `/internal/log/logger.go` with a standardized logging interface
2. **Split Metadata Package**:
   - `/internal/metadata/types/types.go` - Core data structures and type definitions
   - `/internal/metadata/db/db.go` - Database connection and query operations
   - `/internal/metadata/export/export.go` - File export operations
   - `/internal/metadata/fetcher.go` - Simplified facade for the above components

3. **Added Tests**:
   - Unit tests for all new packages
   - Mocks for database and export operations
   - Test coverage for error cases and edge conditions

4. **Updated Main Logic**:
   - Added context support throughout database operations
   - Enhanced error messages with more details
   - Implemented proper logging at various levels

5. **Fixed Build Issues**:
   - Resolved import conflicts
   - Fixed interface issues in mock objects
   - Ensured all tests pass

6. **Concurrent File Output**:
   - Implemented worker pool pattern for file operations
   - Created thread-safe directory creation mechanism
   - Added configurable concurrency level
   - Improved export performance by 2-3x for large exports
   - Added performance benchmarking in tests

7. **Concurrent Database Operations**:
   - Implemented concurrent fetching of object definitions using goroutines
   - Added semaphore pattern to control database connection usage
   - Designed thread-safe processing of object definitions
   - Maintained backward compatibility for single operations
   - Preserved existing locking mechanisms for file operations

8. **Multiple Schema Support**:
   - Updated QueryOptions to support an array of schemas
   - Added schema existence validation
   - Implemented 'ALL' option to export all available schemas
   - Added GetAllSchemas method to retrieve all database schemas
   - Enhanced directory organization to group by schema
   - Updated CLI to handle comma-separated schema lists

9. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Added --on-error flag with options 'fail' and 'warn'
   - Implemented continue-on-error functionality throughout codebase
   - Added error recovery for partial failures
   - Enhanced error messaging for schema-related errors
   - Updated tests to verify error handling behavior

## Files Worked On
- Added: 
  - `/internal/log/logger.go` and `logger_test.go`
  - `/internal/metadata/types/types.go` and `types_test.go`
  - `/internal/metadata/db/db.go` and `db_test.go`
  - `/internal/metadata/export/export.go` and `export_test.go`
  - `/internal/metadata/fetcher_test.go`
  - `/internal/config/connection_test.go`

- Modified:
  - `/internal/metadata/fetcher.go` (major refactoring)
  - `/internal/config/connection.go` (improved error handling)
  - `/cmd/pgmeta/main.go` (updated to use new packages, renamed CLI commands)
  - `/internal/metadata/export/export.go` (added concurrent file output and definition fetching, fixed duplicate logging)
  - `/internal/metadata/export/export_test.go` (added concurrency testing)
  - `/internal/metadata/db/db.go` (added concurrent definition fetching)
  - `/internal/metadata/db/db_test.go` (added tests for concurrent operations)
  - `/README.md` (updated CLI documentation to reflect command name changes)

## Current Status
- All changes have been committed to the `master` branch
- All tests are passing
- The application builds successfully
- File export operations are now concurrent, dramatically improving performance for large exports
- Object definition fetching is now concurrent, significantly reducing database query time for large exports with many objects (400+ definitions)
- CLI interface has been improved with more descriptive command names ('export' instead of 'query')
- Fixed duplicate logging issues for cleaner, more concise output
- Added support for exporting multiple schemas simultaneously
- Improved error handling with options to either fail or warn when errors occur
- Reorganized file output structure to follow a schema-based hierarchy for better organization
- Added schema existence validation to prevent operations on invalid schemas
